Question 1.

Since the named pipe is created on the moon server, if the change to redefine the HALF_DUPLEX name was not made. Every
single single who wanted to access the named pipe to read/write would be writing/reading from the same named pipe.
By renaming the pipe to be more unique, it will avoid conflicts and ensuring each pipe has it's own seperate
channel of communication with the process.
