kirkKeyPipe.c    (from question 2 below)
spockKeyPipe.c   (from question 2 below)



0. Read about the topic of NAMED PIPES in file InfoNamedPipes.pdf in this directory.
   It is also available at http://www.cs.torontomu.ca/~dwoit/InfoNamedPipes.pdf
   Note that somewhere in the pdf it says "ls ?l" but it should read "ls -l"
   Understand Named Pipes.

1. The "halfduplex" programs from the pdf have been saved in this directory.
   Copy them to your filespace and run them as shown in the InfoNamedPipes.pdf file.
   Compare the halfduplex.h file to the one in the pdf file and note one line
   differs:
         #define HALF_DUPLEX             "/tmp/halfduplex"
   was changed to:
         #define HALF_DUPLEX             "myPipe"
   Explain what would have happened if we had not made this change, and all students
   in the class were running the programs at once?
  
2. Re-write the kirkKey and spockKey programs from previous lab using
   a named pipe as the method of IPC (Inter-Process Communication), where the 
   command line argument is the name of the pipe.
   Note that functions to close and delete a named pipe are close and unlink, 
   respectively. 
   Name your programs kirkKeyPipe.c and spockKeyPipe.c
