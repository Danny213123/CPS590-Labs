clone_mpmProcess.c (from question 3)
clone_mpmThread.c  (from question 4)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cloneProcess.c is a program in which the main process spawns a child process.
cloneThread.c  is a program in which the main process spawns a "thread" (like a 
               lightweight process).

Note that these programs use a file named test.file
Make sure test.file is in the directory from which you run the executables.

1)	Run cloneProcess
	
	Your output should be (except for pids):
		The variable was: 9
		Part after clone has pid 10992
		I am 10993 and my parent is 10992
		The variable is now: 9
		Read from the file: a

	Explain why the file closure and the variable modification in function
        do_something are not recognized (variable has old value, and file still 
        open).


2) 	Run cloneThread
	Your output should be (except for pids):
		The variable was: 9
		Part after clone has pid 11051
		I am 11052 and my parent is 11051
		The variable is now: 42
		File Read Error: Bad file descriptor

	Explain why the file closure and the variable modification ARE
	recognized (variable has new value, and file closed).

3) 	Copy file fork_mpm.c into a file named clone_mpmProcess.c
	Modify clone_mpmProcess.c so that it accomplishes the same thing, but by using 
	clone instead of fork. Your output should be (except for pids):
		> clone_mpmProcess
   
		This is process(thread) 11501.
		x+y=1
		> 
		This is process(thread) 11502. 
		x+y=7


4) 	Copy clone_mpmProcess.c to clone_mpmThread.c and modify the latter so that
	it spawns a thread (some call it a lightweight process) instead of a process.
	Your output should be (except for pids):
		> clone_mpmThread

		This is process(thread) 11504.
		x+y=1
		> 
		This is process(thread) 11505. 
		x+y=8
